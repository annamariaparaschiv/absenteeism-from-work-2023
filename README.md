# From Raw Data to Insights
## A Python, SQL, and Tableau Data Journey​

### The problem: Absenteeism at a company during work time
- We would like to know whether an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of hours in a workday.​
- Access to such information in advance can enhance decision-making by enabling the reorganization of work processes to prevent productivity losses and improve work quality.

### Problem-Solving Strategy - STEPS
- Data Preprocessing using Python (Pandas library);​
- Applying the Logistic Regression method using Python to make predictions based on the data (using the model and scaler files);​
- Storing the predicted outputs in a SQL Server Database;​
- Analyzing the predicted outputs in Tableau.
